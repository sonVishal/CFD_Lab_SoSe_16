\maketitle

\section{Possible topics}
\begin{itemize}
\item advanced collision operator (e.g. MRT) and regularization
\item boundary conditions
\item sequential and parallel runtime optimizations
\item LBM on GPUs
\item moving objects
\item heat/diffusion of substances in flow
\item memory optimization (LBM)
\item multiphase/multicomponent flows
\end{itemize}

\section{Strategy to find the right topic}
\begin{enumerate}
\item list all topics
\item think of and state a rough idea what the result of the projects would be (e.g. nice looking animation of a certain scenario, performance measure, etc.)
\item select interesting/most promising topics (idea: each person names 2-3 topics of interest)
\item research literature for best 1-3 topics (better before than after we hand it in)
\item select topic that is interesting + has a good literature foundation
\end{enumerate}
