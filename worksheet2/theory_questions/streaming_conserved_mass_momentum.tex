% question 6: Does the streaming rule preserve mass and momentum?

\section{Conservation of mass and momentum in the streaming rule}

TODO: Consider momentum

\subsection{Heuristic argument}

\subsubsection{Single cell}

We have seen that the collision rule conserves mass in a cell.
Assume now that the collision step has happened and we look at at the distributions
streaming into a cell. The distribution in each direction streaming in is only 
dependant on the state after the previous collision in the neighbouring cells.
That means that all the $Q$ distributions being streamed into our cell are
independent of each other, and hence the density in the current cell may be 
different than before the streaming.


\subsubsection{Over neighbouring cells}

The same argument as before may be applied to a collection of cells which are not
the entire domain. If we have a subset of cells there is always some that stream
out of the subset and get distributions streamed in from the outside. Since the 
distributions streamed in are independent of each other the mass in this subset
of cells is not necessarily conserved between timesteps.
