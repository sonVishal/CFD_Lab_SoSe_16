% question 6: Does the streaming rule preserve mass and momentum?

\section{Conservation of mass and momentum in the streaming rule}

\subsection{Heuristic argument}

\subsubsection{Single cell}

We have seen that the collision rule conserves mass in a cell.
Assume now that the collision step has happened and we look at at the distributions
streaming into a cell. The distribution in each direction streaming in is only 
dependant on the state after the previous collision in the neighbouring cells.
That means that all the $Q$ distributions being streamed into our cell are
independent of each other, and hence the density in the current cell may be 
different than before the streaming.


\subsubsection{Over neighbouring cells}
